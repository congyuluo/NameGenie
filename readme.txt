Welcome to the NameGenie reproducible package. This package contains the programs used to generate the results in the
paper. Please make sure you have the following requirements, which was the environment which we performed tests in:
- Apple Silicon powered Mac computer running macOS 12.6
- Python 3.9
- The following python packages:

- JetBrains InteliJ IDEA Ultimate 2024.1

Do the following configurations in common.py:

After all of the prerequisites are met, run the following color calibrations on your monitor using OSX's digital color
meter, and fill it in the file. This is because NameGenie interacts with InteliJ's renaming functionalities through
GUI. Make sure to test the colors of the following elements on your InteliJ IDE, otherwise it will not work:

- (color_1):
Click on a refactorable variable in the IDE, and press Shift + F6 to rename it. The blue window shall show up, at
this time, use the color meter to measure the background color of the blue window. Fill in the color in the file. You
should get something like (33, 66, 131), do not use my value, as it will not work for different monitors.

- (color_2):
Create an error in the code, and hover over the error. The red window shall show up, at this time, use the color meter
to measure the background color of the red window. Fill in the color in the file. You should get something like
(148, 37, 35).

- (color_3):
Click on an unrefactorable name in the code, and press Shift + F6 to rename it. The red window should pop-up, use
the color meter to find the background color of the window. Expect something like (109, 23, 44).

- (color_4):
Click on a function name with testing usage, and press Shift + F6 to rename it. Enter a new name, and hit enter. The
selection window should pop-up, use the color meter to find the blue color of the window. Expect something like
(47, 101, 202).

- (color_5):
Refactor an identifier name using the rename function, and press Command + Z to undo the change. The undo window should
show up. Use the color meter to find the color of the button. Expect something like (54, 88, 128)

Open a project using IntelliJ, and wait for the IDE to finish indexing. Make sure there are no existing errors in the
code as indicated by IntelliJ.

Place IntelliJ window on your display #1 (if you have multiple displays). Scale the window below 350*350 pixels. Put it
in the top left corner of the screen. Place terminal window, or IDE window for NameGenie on the right side.

- Configure your own openai API key in the file. (API_KEY)
- Configure the root directory you would like to refactor in the file. (refactoring_directory)
- Select the sampling ratio you would like to use in the file. (1 means all, 2 means half, 3 means one third, etc.)
(sampling_ratio)
- Use the pre_test.py to test the parsing and sampling ratio of the code.

Run NameGenie with running main.py (Please use the included SampleProject to test the tool).

During running the tool, if the tool encounters problems, adjust the parameters in the code accordingly. The tool is to
automatically stop if there is a problem. If the tool stops, manually fix the problem in the IDE, and continue to run by
entering something in the terminal window, which NameGenie takes over again.

After running, NameGenie shall exit with zero exit code. "logs" directory should be generated, and log.txt contains
the resulting refactorings.

We apologize as the current version of the tool is extremely difficult to operate, and we are working on adapting this
tool to work through interfaces other than GUI.
